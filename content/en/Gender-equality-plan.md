### Introduction and Commitment

Rework-Space recognizes equality, diversity, and inclusion as essential values of modern and responsible business.
We are committed to ensuring equal opportunities for all employees regardless of gender, age, or background and to 
promoting a safe and respectful working environment.

This Gender Equality Plan (GEP) is approved and signed by the company’s top management and is publicly available on 
our official website.

### Objectives

The purpose of this Gender Equality Plan is to:

- ensure equal opportunities in recruitment, promotion, and access to professional development;
- promote gender balance in leadership and decision-making roles;
- integrate gender equality principles in all business and research processes;
- prevent and respond to gender-based discrimination and harassment;
- support a healthy work-life balance and inclusive organizational culture.

### Governance and Resources

Implementation of this plan is coordinated by the Gender Equality Coordinator: 
- Halyna Brevus, CEO, po@rework-space.com

The Coordinator is responsible for:
- monitoring progress and reporting annually to management;
- organizing awareness and training activities;
- supporting management and HR in implementing equality measures.

Dedicated human resources and administrative support are allocated for these activities as part of the company’s CEO 
functions.

### Data Collection and Monitoring

The company annually collects and analyses gender-disaggregated data on staff composition, roles, promotions, and 
salaries. Data are reviewed at the management level to identify potential imbalances and propose corrective measures.

Results of monitoring are included in the Annual Equality Report, shared internally and upon request with partners or 
donors.

### Training and Awareness

To ensure understanding and implementation of equality principles:
- Regular awareness sessions and training on gender equality and unconscious bias are organized for employees and 
managers;
- online materials and EU resources (e.g., EU Academy, Horizon Europe guidance) are used for cost-effective delivery;
- participation in training is encouraged for all new staff members during onboarding.
