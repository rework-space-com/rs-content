In a world where cloud technologies are the backbone of any digital business, effective infrastructure management
becomes not just a technical task, but a strategic advantage. For us, the Rework-Space team, this challenge became our
starting point. We saw companies working with dozens of services across different cloud providers losing control, facing
rising costs and chaos in their configurations. Thus was born the idea of RS-DataPlatform - a solution that gives 
engineers back control and transparency. It is based on an open source project created by the Rework-Space team

 which is actively used and developed by the community from different countries on the GitHub platform.

But an idea, even the strongest one, needs resources to get started. How do you turn an ambitious concept into a real
product, especially with the limited resources of a young startup? For us, the
{{< color-link link_title="Seeds of Bravery (UASEEDs)" path="https://seedsofbravery.eu/" target="_blank" >}},
 grant program was that opportunity. This is the story of our journey - from the first line of code to the first 
funding received.

### {{< color-text text="Step 1: Finding the right partner, not just money" >}}

At the beginning of 2025, we had a clear technical vision but faced a classic dilemma: where to find resources?  
For a Ukrainian deep-tech startup is always a difficult quest to secure the necessary funding. We were looking not just 
for investment, but for "smart money" - support that would include expertise, mentorship, and access to a community of 
like-minded people.

The Innovative Entrepreneurship program from Seeds of Bravery (UASEEDs) immediately caught our attention. Unlike many 
other funds, it focused on innovation and long-term potential, not on immediate monetization. It was a chance not only 
to get funding but also to become part of a European ecosystem that supports bold technological solutions.

The application process was a real test for us and at the same time an incredibly useful experience. It pushed us to go
beyond technical details and look at our project through the eyes of a business.

**KPIs and budget:** How do you measure success at an early stage? We decided to focus on specific, achievable goals:
testing the idea in a lab environment and attracting the first pilot clients for testing to get initial feedback.
Budgeting forced us to soberly assess the cost of development.

**Lean Canvas:** Filling out this document became a strategic planning session for us. What unique value do we offer?
How will we deliver it? It was here that we clearly formulated that our goal is not just "another tool for DevOps," but
a platform for achieving a company's digital sovereignty.

This painstaking work turned our abstract idea into a structured plan. We realized that a successful application is not
a request for money, but a partnership proposal where we clearly show how the resources invested in us will turn into
measurable results.

### {{< color-text text="Tips for startups seeking funding:" >}}

Our experience is still small, but we have already learned a few important rules that we want to share:

1. **Believe in your idea, but be prepared to defend it with numbers.** Your passion is inspiring, but investors and
   grant committees think in terms of risks and potential. Show them the market, the problem, and a clear plan to solve
   it.
2. **Documents are not bureaucracy, but strategy.** Don't treat the application as a formality. Use it as an opportunity
   to structure your own vision. A detailed budget and well-thought-out KPIs are proof of your professionalism.
3. **Be flexible, because nothing will go according to plan.** Conditions change, unforeseen circumstances arise. Your
   ability to adapt quickly is your main asset.
4. **View the grant as a smart partnership.** Money is only part of the value. Mentorship, access to the community, and
   new connections are just as important. Actively use these opportunities.

Our journey with Seeds of Bravery is just beginning. Months of intensive work are ahead, but we have already
received much more than financial support. We have gained confidence in our abilities, a clear action plan, and
invaluable experience. We hope our story will inspire other teams not to be afraid to turn bold ideas into real
products.
